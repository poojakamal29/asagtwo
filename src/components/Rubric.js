              text = "Patient is a 45M with no significant PMHx presenting with back pain that started 3 weeks ago after attempting to catch a heavy object mid-air. His pain is located bilaterally on his lower back which was initially a 3/10 that has progressively worsened to a 6/10 which he describes as 'knife-like'. It does not radiate anywhere and he has been taking ibuprofen and acetaminophen without relief. He states that resting and laying down improved the pain but activity worsens the pain. He is concerned about prostate mets because his father passed 6 months ago from prostate cancer and had back pain related to mets. He denies any sweating, night sweats, chills, fevers. Denies any nausea or vomiting.  Denies any difficulty urinating, shortness of breath, or suprapubic pain. "
